Hello, I am a supervisor in SEO/ASO company named "Adecco".
My name is Mia. I am currently living in Seattle. My occupation is nurse. What I want to introduce to you is my another job. Because this job has more flexible hours, it can suit you whether you already have a job or not.
I'm interested in inviting people to this project. 
Let me introduce the job to you. We work on the *Adecco platform*, a digital marketing company that collaborates with app companies like *Activision, Sony, Electronic Arts*, and others globally. *Job responsibility* is to optimize apps to maintain and increase their popularity, benefiting both users and developers.
It requires only 1-2 hours of work daily, with flexible hours from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm (GMT-7), allowing you to manage it alongside other commitments. You can start working with a mobile phone or computer and choose your work location.
The salary is based on optimizing more than 120 applications daily. After optimizing each product, you receive an immediate rebate. You can earn about $100 to $800 USDT/day, which can be withdrawn immediately after completing the work. Additionally, there's a basic salary. The monthly basic salary is $6900+ USDT, received every two days, with approximately $250 USDT per day.
For example, if an app costs $500 and generates $50 in profit, our maintenance work can earn us rebates of $10 to $20 per app. The Adecco platform receives over $30, ensuring a win-win situation for all involved. Our services actually lead to increased sales for merchants, despite appearing to reduce their profits initially.
I've been working on the Adecco platform for 6 months, gaining valuable experience in maintaining products. If you have any questions or need clarification, please let me know. Joining us could also earn you rewards for recommending new members, so I'll contact you through the recruitment company.
To begin, I'll walk you through registering a free work account on the platform using just your phone number, no personal information required. You'll receive a $30 newbie reward upon registration.
After registering, I'll guide you through maintaining products, which involves learning the workflow and receiving a rebate of approximately $70-80. The training session lasts 30-60 minutes.
